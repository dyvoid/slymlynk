# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-04

## Context

This project is developed with AI assistance. An AI agent (or a new contributor) reading the code
has no access to the conversations where decisions were made. Without a written record, deliberate
choices look like arbitrary ones and get silently undone in the next refactor.

## Decision

We record significant architecture decisions as ADRs in `docs/adr/`, numbered sequentially. Each
captures the context, the decision, and the consequences. AGENTS.md instructs agents not to change
architecture without adding one.

## Consequences

- Decisions are durable and discoverable; the reasoning survives past the chat that produced it.
- There's a small overhead per decision. Worth it for anything an agent might otherwise reverse.
- Superseded decisions stay in the log with status `Superseded by ADR XXXX`, not deleted.
